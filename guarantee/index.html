          <h2>Guarantee Terms</h2>
          <p>These Guarantee Terms apply to CS PRIME ACADEMY LTD (company number 16908846), registered office: 34 Harrow Way, Watford, England, WD19 5ET.<br>They explain how the “+1 grade in 3 months or money back” promise works.</p>

          <h3>1. What the guarantee means</h3>
          <p>If the Student meets all eligibility conditions below and does not achieve at least a one grade improvement within the guarantee period, the Client can request a refund of Programme fees paid for that guarantee period, as set out in section 6.</p>

          <h3>2. Guarantee period</h3>
          <p>The guarantee period is 3 months starting from the date of the first paid Lesson under The Breakthrough Programme.</p>

          <h3>3. What counts as “+1 grade”</h3>
          <p>“+1 grade” means an improvement of at least one full grade compared to the Student’s documented baseline grade, based on a comparable assessment.<br>Examples:<br>- from C to B, or from B to A, or from A to A*<br>A “comparable assessment” means one of:<br>(a) an official school mock exam result, or<br>(b) a timed past paper completed under exam conditions with a mark and grade awarded using the relevant exam board grade boundaries, or<br>(c) another assessment method we both agree in writing before the guarantee period starts.</p>

          <h3>4. Baseline and outcome evidence</h3>
          <p>Baseline:<br>- Must be recorded within the first 14 days of the guarantee period.<br>- Evidence must be provided (school report, marked paper, or agreed assessment record).<br><br>Outcome:<br>- Must be recorded within the last 14 days of the guarantee period, or within 14 days after it ends if scheduling requires it.<br>- Evidence must be provided in the same way as the baseline.</p>

          <h3>5. Eligibility conditions</h3>
          <p>The guarantee applies only if all of the following are met:<br>(a) Attendance: the Student attends all scheduled Lessons, except for the reschedule allowance stated on the website (or otherwise agreed in writing).<br>(b) Homework and tasks: the Student completes the agreed tasks and homework on time, to a reasonable standard.<br>(c) Cooperation: the Student follows the agreed study plan and sits the agreed assessments needed to measure progress.<br>(d) Information: the Client and Student provide accurate exam board, specification, and current working level at the start.</p>

          <h3>6. How to claim a refund</h3>
          <p>To claim:<br>- Email billing@csprime.co.uk within 14 days of receiving the outcome evidence.<br>- Include baseline evidence and outcome evidence.<br>If the claim is valid, we will refund 100 percent of the Programme fees paid for the guarantee period. Refunds are made to the original payment method where possible, within a reasonable processing time.</p>

          <h3>7. Exclusions</h3>
          <p>The guarantee does not apply where:<br>(a) the Student misses Lessons beyond the allowed reschedules,<br>(b) the Student does not complete assigned work consistently,<br>(c) baseline or outcome evidence is not provided,<br>(d) the Student changes exam board or the target specification mid period in a way that makes comparison unreasonable,<br>(e) there is a significant disruption outside our control that prevents delivery or assessment (for example prolonged illness). In such cases, we will act reasonably and may extend the period or agree an alternative measurement method.</p>

          <h3>8. Fairness</h3>
          <p>We will apply these terms reasonably and in good faith. Nothing here limits any statutory consumer rights.<br><br>If you have questions, contact billing@csprime.co.uk</p>
